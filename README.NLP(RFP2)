AS IT IS IN PDF WE NEED TO EXTRACT IT FIRST FOR THAT :
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader,PdfFileWriter
import PyPDF2 as pdf

next  we are importing the NLTK toolkit: import nltk.

we proceed with Basics of NLP for Text:
Sentence Tokenization
Word Tokenization
Text Lemmatization and Stemming
Stop Words
Regex

FOR GETTING ALL PAGES PRINTED IN PDF WE ADD FOR LOOP:
 i in range(pdf_reader.getNumPages()):
    page = pdf_reader.getPage(i)
    i +=1
    final+=page.extractText()
    

and AT LAST  we can do df-idf model or bagging of words or both for better performance.(which assign weights ).
PLEASE CHECK THE CODE FOR DETAIL UNDERSTANDING.
